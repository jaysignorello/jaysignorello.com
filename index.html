        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Jay Signorello is an experienced entrepreneur and technology leader.
          He co-founded <a href="https://www.nakedapartments.com" target="_blank">Naked Apartments</a> in 2009, serving as CTO. Jay and his team
          bootstrapped Naked Apartments into New York Cityâ€™s largest rentals-only
          platform. Naked Apartments was <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/zillow-continues-aggressive-acquisition-path-pays-13m-to-purchase-naked-apartments/" target="_blank">acquired by Zillow Group</a> as it's
          fifth consumer brand in 2016.
          <br><br>
          At Zillow Group, Jay held the position of VP of Engineering,
          overseeing engineering management and
          product teams for three NYC focused brands
          (StreetEasy, Naked Apartments, and Out East).
          <br><br>
          Between 2006 and 2009, Jay managed engineering teams at Pepperjam
          (acquired by Ebay) and Heavy.com. At Pepperjam, he was the
          Director of Software Development, where he led the team to
          build several products, most notably the Pepperjam Affiliate
           Network platform. At Heavy.com, Jay was Lead developer,
           spearheading the development of an innovative video ad
           network platform named HuskyMedia.
          <br><br>
          From 2000 to 2006, Jay owned and operated his first business,
          DWS Designs, a web development consulting business, which focused on
          creating Content Management Systems (CMS) for clients
          <br><br>
          Mostly recently, Jay left Zillow Group and is in the early stages of his next startup.
          From time to time, he advises founders of startups on management,
          product strategy, and running lean.
          <br><br>
          Jay holds a Bachelor's in Information Sciences and Technology
          from Pennsylvania State University.
          <br><br>
          He resides in Northern New Jersey with his wife and three beautiful kids.
          He has a passion for reading and building physical things
          (currently fine wood furniture). Most of all,
          he loves to play with his rambunctious kids
          ("Daddy monster" is their favorite game).
