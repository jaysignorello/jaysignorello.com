I'm a product-obsessed technical leader who loves building things that make people's lives tangibly better. I've always been drawn to the overlap between great product and great engineering — building things that work beautifully, scale cleanly, and actually get used. I care as much about how something feels as how it's built.

I co-founded Naked Apartments in 2009, bootstrapped it to profitability with a fully remote team (rare at the time), and grew it into New York City's largest rentals-only platform. Naked Apartments was <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/zillow-continues-aggressive-acquisition-path-pays-13m-to-purchase-naked-apartments/" target="_blank">acquired by Zillow Group</a> in 2016, where I stayed on as VP of Engineering leading 90+ engineers across their NYC brands (StreetEasy, Naked Apartments, and Out East).

Before Naked Apartments, I managed engineering teams at Pepperjam (acquired by eBay) and Heavy.com, and before that ran my own web development consulting business from 2000 to 2006.

After Zillow, I stepped away from big orgs to get back to what I love: building, experimenting, and moving fast.

In addition to building, I invest in early-stage infrastructure, data, and machine learning startups through <a href="https://www.irregex.vc/" target="_blank">IrregEx</a>. We back teams with strong technical foundations and product instincts.

I'm always up for a conversation with founders, builders, or anyone chasing something ambitious — whether that means lending a hand through advisory, strategic consulting, or exploring what's next.

I hold a Bachelor's in Information Sciences and Technology from Pennsylvania State University. I live in Northern New Jersey with my wife and three kids. Outside of work, I have a passion for reading and building physical things (currently fine wood furniture).
